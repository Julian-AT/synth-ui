# 🎨 Synth UI - AI-Powered UI Components

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Synth UI is an open source approach to [verce's v0](https://v0.dev/). Synth UI is not affiliated with vercel or their v0 product.

> [!TIP]
> For all information regarding creation of the datasets, training of the model and how to use the model for your own projects, please refer to the [Dataset & Model Monorepo](https://github.com/Julian-AT/synth-ui-training).

# 🚀 About this project

> [!WARNING]
> This project is currently in an experimental stage and is not intended for production use or commercial applications. Synth UI is a research and development project aimed at exploring the possibilities of generative UI with natural language.

## 🎯 Key Goals

✨ **Automate UI Development:**  
Transform natural language input into ready-to-use React components, reducing manual effort.

🎓 **Lower the Learning Curve:**  
Even non-technical users can generate functional UI components without deep programming skills.

⚡ **Boost Productivity:**  
Teams can focus on creative, complex tasks while routine UI generation is handled by AI.

🔄 **Modular & Reusable Components:**  
Every component generated is easy to reuse, promoting consistency and speeding up future development.

## 📦 What's Included?

- **📝 Text-to-Code Generation:**  
  Create React components effortlessly from text input.

- **🎛️ Customizable Components:**  
  Tailor each component to your specific needs.

- **🧠 LLM Support:**  
  Works with multiple large language models (LLMs) to ensure versatility.

- **📚 Component Library:**  
  Access to 5 UI libraries with **100+ reusable components**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Specs

**🏗️ Architecture:**  
A modular design featuring a central **AI core** and multiple agents that handle tasks efficiently.

**💾 Data Model:**  
Chat data stored in Redis, with other data handled via external sources for better scalability (Clerk Auth).

**🔒 Security:**  
Includes user authentication, authorization, and encrypted communication between client and server.

Please note:

- Synth UI is not production-ready and may contain bugs or inconsistencies.
- The generated UI code should be thoroughly reviewed and tested before any use in real-world applications.
- We do not recommend using Synth UI for commercial projects at this time.
- This project is primarily for educational and experimental purposes.

We encourage contributions and feedback from the community to help improve Synth UI, but please be aware of its current limitations and experimental nature.
