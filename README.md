# About this project

> [!WARNING]
> This project is currently in an experimental stage and is not intended for production use or commercial applications. Synth UI is a research and development project aimed at exploring the possibilities of generative UI with natural language.

Please note:

- Synth UI is not production-ready and may contain bugs or inconsistencies.
- The generated UI code should be thoroughly reviewed and tested before any use in real-world applications.
- We do not recommend using Synth UI for commercial projects at this time.
- This project is primarily for educational and experimental purposes.

We encourage contributions and feedback from the community to help improve Synth UI, but please be aware of its current limitations and experimental nature.
